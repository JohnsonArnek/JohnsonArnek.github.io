// Import Minima's core styles (if you want to build upon them)
// You might need to adjust this path if you've customized Minima extensively
// or are using a different theme structure.
// For a standard Minima gem-based theme, this line might be tricky to get right
// if you haven't "ejected" Minima's SASS files.
// A common way to include Minima's styles when customizing is to copy
// its _sass folder into your project and import 'minima'.
// For now, let's assume Minima's base styles are loaded.

// Import your custom SASS partials
@import "custom/variables";    // Your custom variables (colors, fonts, etc.)
@import "custom/layout";       // General layout adjustments
@import "custom/projects";     // Styles specifically for project listings and details
// Add more imports as your site grows
