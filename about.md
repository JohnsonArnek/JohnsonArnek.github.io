    <p>Hello! I'm <strong>VB</strong>, the curator of this "Idea Graveyard." I identify as a professional Jack of all trades, master of none, driven by an insatiable curiosity that spans a multitude of domains.</p>

    <p>This website is my digital workshop and archive – a place where ideas, both fleeting and persistent, are explored, documented, and sometimes laid to rest. It's a reflection of my journey through diverse interests, from the structured logic of coding and economics to the boundless creativity of art and writing, and the ever-evolving landscapes of AI, technological progress, history, and politics.</p>

    <h2>A Tapestry of Interests</h2>
    <p>My mind rarely stays still. I find myself constantly drawn to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Side Projects:</strong> The thrill of building something new, no matter how small or experimental.</li>
      <li><strong>Art & Creativity:</strong> Exploring different mediums and forms of expression.</li>
      <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence:</strong> Its potential, its implications, and its intersection with humanity.</li>
      <li><strong>Writing:</strong> From technical documentation to speculative fiction, a way to clarify thoughts and share stories.</li>
      <li><strong>Coding:</strong> The art of problem-solving and creating with logic.</li>
      <li><strong>Business & Economics:</strong> Understanding the systems that shape our world.</li>
      <li><strong>Reading:</strong> Voraciously consuming knowledge across genres.</li>
      <li><strong>Politics & History:</strong> Learning from the past to understand the present and future.</li>
      <li><strong>Technological Progress:</strong> How innovation shapes society and individual lives.</li>
      <li>...and truly, much more!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Philosophy of the Graveyard</h2>
    <p>Why an "Idea Graveyard"? Because not all ideas need to become fully realized masterpieces to be valuable. Some are stepping stones, some are thought experiments, and some are simply enjoyable explorations. This site is about celebrating the process of thinking, learning, and creating, without the pressure of perfection or completion for every single concept.</p>
    <p>Here, you'll find a mix of finished pieces, works-in-progress, and perhaps even a few well-documented "failures" – because there's learning in every outcome.</p>

    <h2>Get in Touch</h2>
    <p>I'm always open to discussing new ideas, collaborating on intriguing projects, or just connecting with fellow curious minds. The best way to reach me is via email:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a></li>
